# Guessthatnumber
This code is a Python program that lets the user play a number guessing game. The game starts by asking the user's name, and then prompts the user to choose a range of numbers to guess from. The user then has to guess a randomly generated number within the chosen range. The game will provide hints if the user's guess is too high or too low. The user has 10 attempts to guess the number, and if they fail, they are given the option to cheat and reveal the number. If the user guesses the number within the allotted attempts, they win the game.

The program uses a while loop to keep the game going until the user chooses to quit. Within the while loop, there are nested while loops that handle the guessing of the number and the cheating option.

Overall, the code is well-organized and easy to read. The use of functions could make it more modular and easier to maintain, but that is not strictly necessary for a program of this size. One potential issue is that the program does not validate the user's input when selecting the range of numbers to guess from, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the user enters an invalid choice.
