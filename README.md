# Guess That Number
This is a number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The player can choose from three range options: 1 to 1000, 1 to 100000, or 1 to 1000000. The game keeps track of the player's score, which is the number of attempts it takes for them to correctly guess the number. If the player is unable to guess the number within 10 attempts, they have the option to cheat by getting the correct answer. However, if the player chooses to cheat, their score will not be recorded on the leaderboard. Invalid inputs are caught and do not count towards the player's score. The game also displays a leaderboard of the top scores for each range option.
